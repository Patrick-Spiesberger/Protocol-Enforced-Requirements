# Ethereum: Protocol Enforced Requirements
:warning: This repository is incomplete and currently a work in progress (WIP). Please carefully evaluate the Smart Contracts provided here before using them.

## :fast_forward: Preamble
Protocol Enforced Requirements (PER) is a concept rooted in Protocol Enforced Proposer Commitments ([PEPC](https://ethresear.ch/t/unbundling-pbs-towards-protocol-enforced-proposer-commitments-pepc/13879/4)) and specifically requires the implementation of these commitments. For this approach, we are inclined towards an in-protocol solution for PEPC, particularly considering the Commitment-Satisfaction Committees ([CSC](https://ethresear.ch/t/commitment-satisfaction-committees-an-in-protocol-solution-to-pepc/17055)) as referenced in [EIP-7732](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7732). An alternative approach is provided by 0xfuturistic with "[Emily](https://github.com/0xfuturistic/emily): A Protocol for Credible Commitments". 

## :fast_forward: Structure
### Requirement Manager
This repository includes a Smart Contract, `RequirementManager.sol`, which acts as a registry for requirements received by an entity (Applicant, Proposer, Builder) within the network, facilitating the management of these requirements. This Smart Contract stores encoded byte strings representing objects of the type `Requirement`. The goal is to allow an entity in the network to register an encoded requirement in the contract, with the decoded version and the entityâ€™s address being stored within the contract. To verify whether a specific condition is met for:
1. The inclusion of a transaction, OR
2. The creation of a block, OR
3. The status of an entity,
   
the decoded requirement (including the properties discussed below) can be retrieved from the register. Each entity can create at most one `Requirement`, but they can also delete or modify parts of it. A `Requirement` remains valid until it is removed from the register. To avoid equivocation, we need to ensure, that a `Requirement`is finalized (using mechanisms like Gasper or SSF).

### Requirement
A `Requirement` is fundamentally divided into three sections:
1. **PreRequirements**: These requirements contain `Conditions` that must be met before the Main and PostRequirements can be evaluated. PreRequirements serve as a preliminary check to model conditions related to the entity rather than the block itself. A typical example of a `PreRequirement` is the condition `CommittedTo.sol`, which verifies whether a specific entity has registered a particular requirement in the `RequirementManager`.
2. **MainRequirement**: This type of requirement focuses on properties related to the block that needs to be verified. For instance, it is possible to create a condition that requires a builder to include a transaction at a specific position within the block.
3. **PostRequirement**: These requirements signify a status that must be present in the network. This status is managed in the form of a requirement, which can be considered as a promise. For example, a proposer might issue a requirement to produce an honest, censorship-free inclusion list. `PostRequirements` cannot be verified as a block or entity condition within the current slot, but can only be checked in the subsequent slot.

A `Requirement` is a bundle of these three sections, with each type of requirement containing a list of Conditions that must ALL be met. Verification is currently possible only at the `Condition` level and not within the `Requirement` itself.

### Condition
A `Condition` object must implement the `ICondition` interface. This interface includes an `isFulfilled` method, which defines the criteria under which the condition is considered met. We have already created appropriate conditions for all fields of a block accessible through the Solidity interface, and these can be found under `src/Conditions`.
An overview of the structure and the conditions can be found in the following UML diagram

## :fast_forward: How to create a Requirement
In the `RequirementManager`, a requirement can be registered via an encoded string. To generate this string, a `Requirement` object, composed of the sections described above, is needed. For each of the Pre-, Main-, and PostRequirements, an object can be created with an initial list of conditions that is empty. This is done as follows:

1. `PreRequirement preRequirement = new PreRequirement();`
2. `MainRequirement mainRequirement = new MainRequirement();`
3. `PostRequirement postRequirement = new PostRequirement();`

Next, a condition must be specified. You can either add a new condition (which must be deployed as a smart contract on the blockchain) or use an existing condition. For example, if you want to create a condition that pertains to the block header, it would look like this:

```solidity
BlockHeaderConditions condition_example = new BlockHeaderConditions(
    42,
    address(0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678),
    8000000,
    1000000000,
    1,
    0,
    42
);
```
